I recommend to use the Open Document Format (ODF) for processing of office documents and do this outside a Big Data platform

# hadoopoffice
HadoopOffice - Analyze and write Office documents, such as MS Excel, using the Hadoop ecosystem including Apache Hive/Apache Flink/Apache Spark.


You find more information about the project in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ZuInnoTe/hadoopoffice/wiki).
